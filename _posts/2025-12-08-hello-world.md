I am passionate about technology and automation, but also about everything that lies beyond the obvious.

After many years, I am creating a blog again. In my teenage years, I had one on Blogger about poetry and short stories, so this feels like coming home. However, more than just a blog, this will be a record of my reality.

## Who Am I?

Let me introduce myself properly. By day, I am a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** specializing in the Linux ecosystem, AWS, Ansible, and Python. I’m from Mexico (I love my country), and I currently lead a technical team.


Beyond the screen, I am grounded by nature. My ultimate dream is to own a ranch, grow my own food, and live surrounded by green. For now, I find balance in:
* **Reading:** I oscillate between devouring books/manga daily for months and then taking long breaks.
* **Gaming:** I love vast worlds and RPGs. You’ll often find me in *Skyrim*, *Baldur's Gate*, or suffering through the *Souls* saga (FromSoftware).
* **Philosophy:** I practice Stoicism and "Declared Intention" to navigate life.

## The Wake-Up Call: The Monitor Story

Lately, I've felt that the years are moving differently. Time passes faster than before, not just in my daily life, but everywhere. This perception led me to a harsh realization that changed my perspective on my career and my life.

It happened on a random day. I logged into Amazon to look up a monitor I had bought. I would have sworn I bought it a year ago, maybe a year and a half at most.
**The order date showed it had been over 5 years.**

I froze. *What have I done all these years?*

I realized I had spent 8 years on autopilot. I focused on working, striving, and delivering results imposed by others—goals that weren't even my own. In that race, I lost time, and more painfully, I lost touch with important people.

Don't get me wrong, those years brought achievements and learning. But looking back, I realized I had fallen into a trap.

## The Trap of Productivity

We are in a constant race to achieve "big goals." Social media sells us the idea that if you don't wake up at 4:00 AM to "hustle," you aren't successful.

I recently spoke with a friend who told me: *"I got off work early today, so I took the opportunity to do groceries, meal prep, and laundry to get ahead of the weekend. But by nightfall, I felt like I hadn't made the most of my day."*

I told her: **"You didn't let yourself enjoy it. A free day became a chore day."**

We forget to enjoy the small things. I fight against these intrusive thoughts myself. Sometimes, when I sit down to play a video game or just stare at the ceiling, a voice says: *"You are not being productive."*

But that voice is wrong. **Resting is productive.**

### Don't Build a House You Won't Live In

My new philosophy is simple: Don't become the person who spends their whole life building their dream house, waiting for every detail to be perfect before moving in. Because when you least expect it, your life will be over. That house you built with such effort will be enjoyed by someone else, and your time will be gone.

## A New Route

With this context, I have decided to change many aspects of my life. I have a single goal: **to live a full life that I won't regret.**

This blog is the start of that new journey. Here, I will document my path back to technical depth—mastering **Linux, Kubernetes, and certifications**—not just for the sake of work, but to gain the freedom to live on my own terms.

Welcome to my route.
